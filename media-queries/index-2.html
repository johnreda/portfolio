			<img src="assets/images/me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

		<p> My name is John Reda and I'm beginning my career as a web developer. I earned my BFA with a concentration in Photography from Rutgers University in 2014. While still in school, I started working for Apple at their Bridgewater Commons location. I began my career at Apple as a part-time sales specialist. Upon graduating, I moved into a full time role as a mobile certified technician. After spending 6 months in that role, I became an Apple Certfied Mac Technician, which is where I am today.

			<br>
		My hobbies include photography and music, and one of my favorite things to do is visit New York City and explore all of the different neighborhoods.
